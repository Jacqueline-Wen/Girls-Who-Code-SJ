  My name is Jacqueline and I am a 6th grader going to Miller Middle School. I am willing to try new things and I often enjoy the experience of doing new things. That is the reason why I tried coding. 
  
  I enjoy reading watching videos on youtube, and playing badmiton. To me, reading is extremely relaxing and there is nothing I like to do more on a rainy day than lay in bed and read. When I watch youtube, 
  I do not browse around. I only watch one specific channel on youtube. Last, playing badmiton is something I love doing a lot. It is both my favorite sport, and the only sport I play. 
  
  I like coding when I have time, which is why I joined Girls Who Code. I enjoy spending time with other girls and code together. I have made some friends this year at Girls Who Code.
